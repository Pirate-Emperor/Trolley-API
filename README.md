## üí° Usage

You can test the API using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or cURL. Make sure to send requests with the appropriate HTTP methods and payloads as described in the API endpoints section. I have included a Postman collection in the `postman` folder for your convenience.

## üß™ Testing

To run tests for this API, you can use tools like [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). Here‚Äôs how to run the tests:

1. Install the testing dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev mocha chai
```

2. Create a `test` directory and add your test files.

3. Run the tests:

```bash
npx mocha test
```
